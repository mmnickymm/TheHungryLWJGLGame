Ideas for game:
MAIN FUNCTIONALITY:
2-D
shoot em up style side scroller

IDEAS FOR MECHANICS:
all shapes, the more sides a shape has the more dangerous it is, or fractals, the higher the dimmension between 1.0 and 2.0 the greater the danger

MECHANICS NEEDED:
health, damage, projectiles, powerups/upgrades? (maybe sides can represent health and each time an enemy (or you) gets hit you lose a side)
###what does this mean? Does the shape change? will this be to difficult?
points system needed for overal scoring or for added powerups/upgrades 
spawning system for enemies
movement system for enemies
control system for player
render system
Bosses? ## to be added later, let just start simple
menu system
settings for low/medium/high system requirements?  ## We arent really gonna need higher system requirements for now. But we could add
royalty-free music and sound effects  ## Nick is happy figuring out how to make the music
animations for enemies and player
background?  ## Space?

Tools requested:
Git and GitKraken for version control
Gitlab/Github for repository
eclipse for java development
lwjgl

for sound:
audacity for audio file creation
### I have a version of FL Studio

for art:
inkscape so we can use vector graphics to scale the resolution of the game to match its window
